This module provides the set of [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/) for [gomponents](https://www.gomponents.com/).

## Features

- Easy to use
- Easy to customize
- Zero dependencies
- No client-side JavaScript

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/eduardolat/gomponents-lucide
```

## Usage

You can [find your icons here](https://lucide.dev/icons/), convert the name to UpperCamelCase, and use it as a function that receives optional attributes to customize the SVG.

Your code editor should help you with the autocompletion of the name of the functions.

Here is an example:

```go
package main

import (
	"os"
	"github.com/maragudk/gomponents"
	"github.com/maragudk/gomponents/html"
	"github.com/eduardolat/gomponents-lucide"
)

func myPage() gomponents.Node {
	return html.Div(
		lucide.CircleUser(),
		lucide.ChevronUp(),
		lucide.Power(),
		lucide.Star(),
		lucide.Languages(),
		lucide.Usb(),
		//...
		lucide.Cherry(
			// You can add any attributes you want
			// to customize the SVG
			html.Class("w-6 h-6 text-blue-500"),
		),
	)
}

func main() {
	// This prints the HTML to stdout but you can
	// write it to whatever io.Writer you want
	page := myPage()
	page.Render(os.Stdout)
}
```

## Customization

You can customize the SVG icons in two ways: individually and globally.

### Individually

You can use the `html.Class` or `html.Style` attributes to customize the SVG icons individually.

```go
lucide.Cherry(
	html.Class("w-6 h-6 text-blue-500"),
)
```

### Globally

**Every SVG in this module** includes the `data-glucide="icon"` attribute. You can use this attribute to customize all the icons globally using CSS:

```css
svg[data-glucide="icon"] {
  stroke-width: 4;
  stroke: red;
}
```

This approach ensures that any SVG icon with the `data-glucide="icon"` attribute will inherit the styles defined in your CSS, making it easy to maintain a consistent appearance across all icons in your project.
